I'm Ryan Scott, a developer out of the Midwest (Bloomington, Indiana). I primarily develop with Ruby and Rails, but I've been known to dabble in iOS, OS X, and whatever else is right for the job. I started Plays With Code to share some of my projects and thoughts on code, and occasionally technology at large. 

You can always get in touch with me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/rscott), and you can find my projects on [Github](https://github.com/rscott).
